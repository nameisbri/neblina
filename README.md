# Neblina

The website for **Neblina**, a digital product studio based in Ontario, Canada. We help brands find clarity through strategy, design, and thoughtfully-built digital products.

**Live:** [neblina.ca](https://neblina.ca)

## About

Neblina (Portuguese for "mist") represents our approach: helping clients navigate uncertainty until clarity emerges. We offer two paths of work:

- **Consulting** — Brand strategy, product design, creative direction, and technical architecture for teams building with intention
- **Products** — Our own privacy-first software, including [Discloser](https://discloser.app), an app for sharing health information on your own terms

## Design

The site uses a "Blue Hour" visual language—the liminal moment between night and dawn when fog lifts and forms become clear. Key elements:

- Dark atmospheric palette with soft indigo/violet accents
- Serif typography (Cormorant Garamond) for headlines, clean sans-serif (Inter) for body
- Subtle motion and particle effects that respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Custom cursor interactions on desktop

See [STYLE_GUIDE.md](./STYLE_GUIDE.md) for the complete visual identity reference.
